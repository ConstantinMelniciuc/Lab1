So you've chosen your projects. It's time to file down the requirements for the solution you are developing.

Part 1. Creating the System Vision.
---

At first, one needs to create a representation of the problem description. It can be provided as a table or a list and should include the following sections:

**1. Business Context**

*Who will use the solution, how will it stand with other solutions. 2 sentences of the backround about where the system will reside*

**2. Business Opportunities**

*4-6 sentences that will describe the problem and the need for the solution. What will happen when you deliver the solution?*

**3. Problem Description**

*This section should be split into several parts:*

- Problem

	*One sentence about the problem. Explain it at the best of your ability. Brevity matters.*

- Concerns

	*Who is encountering the problem now*

- Concequences

	*What are the concequences of the problem. How does it impede work?*

- Successful solution

	*What key points will your solution deliver? Long/short run? 2 sentences*

- Task of the system

	*Therefore, what are you aiming to solve. Keep it as short as possible. 1 sentence.*

Part 2. Identifying the stakeholders
---

The second step is to create a table of *stakeholders* and their responsibilities. The table should contain the following columns:

- Stakeholder
- Role

	*a rough description of the role of this stake holder within the organisation. What do they represent?*

- Description

	*a description of the interaction of the stakeholder with the software system*

The most important part, however, is identifying the stakeholders. They include the immediate users of the system as well as all the secondary affected users, oferators, support, maintenance, etc. While identifying the stakeholders, one should ask himself the following questions:
Who uses the system?

- Who is affected by the introduction of the system?
- Who benefits from the system?
- Who operates the system?
- Who maintains the system?
- Who accepts the system?
- What expectations do the stakeholders have?
- What tasks, competencies, and responsibilities do the stakeholders have?

Part 3. Documenting the functional requirements of the system.
